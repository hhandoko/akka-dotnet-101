This repository (`akka-dotnet-101`) contains the presentation file and code samples for my talk on Akka.NET at the Perth .NET user group meetup on 02/07/2015.

***Notes:***
* `/src` contains the code samples
* `/resources` contains the following:
  * PDF presentation
  * WinMerge source code diff report

PS. I will provide some annotation and notes on the presentation slides soon.
